# 0x4067

## Tutorial Questions

There are 5 tutorial sets, each covering a different aspect of software security and consisting of multiple questions:
1. **CVE**
2. **Hashbrown**
3. **Hexhunt**
4. **Timelapse**
5. **Wacky Web Woes**

Each tutorial has its own folder containing:
- A handout in Markdown and PDF format
- Additional files required in the tutorial

Flags take the format of `0x4067{...}`. However, most questions require short answers instead.  
This is because the focus of the tutorials is not to simply capture flags, but have fun exploring cybersecurity!

## Before Starting...

You are strongly advised to attempt the tutorial questions in the following environment:
- Kali Linux 2023.3 x64
- Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager

Ensure that you are also able to access the internet from the VM.

Kali Linux offers prebuilt VMs, so it might be faster to get your environment up and running.  
It also comes with various tools that you will find useful in these tutorials and future CTFs.

## Attempting the Tutorial Questions

For example, in the Hexhunt tutorial, the executable has the file name `hexhunt.out`.  

To run the executable from Linux terminal,
- Ensure you have permissions to run it by running `chmod +x hexhunt.out`
- Run the executable with `./hexhunt.out`

Be sure to attempt the tutorial questions on your own before looking at the solutions.

Good luck and have fun!

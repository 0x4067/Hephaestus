# 0x4067
*A set of Capture-The-Flag tutorials for NTU's Software Security course*

## Before Starting...

You are strongly advised to attempt the tutorial questions in the following environment:
- Kali Linux 2023.3 x64
- Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager

Kali Linux offers prebuilt virtual machines, so it might be faster to get your environment up and running!

## Tutorial Questions

There are 5 tutorial sets, each covering a different aspect of software security and consisting of multiple questions:
1. **CVE**
2. **Hashbrown**
3. **Hexhunt**
4. **Timelapse**
5. **Wacky Web Woes**

Things to note:
- Each tutorial set will have a file describing the various tasks and questions to complete.
- Flags take the format of `0x4067{...}`. 
- Most of the questions also require some form of short answer :). Capturing the flag is not the main objective -- it is having fun learning about cybersecurity!
- You do not need to reverse engineer any file to complete the tutorials
- Try your best to complete the tutorials without looking at the solutions
